One of my current project. It is simple system to manage Tabletop RPG gameplay. Currently the plan is to allow users add their characters, gameplays, stories and schedule.
If my time and skills allow I would like to turn it into full fledge platform to play various tabletop rgps like Dungeon and Dragons or Savage Worlds.

I got inspired to create this portal after my first ever Savage Worlds campaign where we had to use Google Sheets and Discord to play. It was hard to keep track of various information so I decided to make it simpler.

The project is currently written in:
